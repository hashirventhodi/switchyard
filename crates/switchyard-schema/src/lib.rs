//! The one typed stream between the Switchyard core and the renderer.
//!
//! Every [`Command`] the renderer may send and every [`Event`] the core may emit lives
//! here. TypeScript is generated from these types into `ui/src/schema/` by ts-rs; run
//! `cargo test -p switchyard-schema` to regenerate it, and commit the result.
//!
//! Wire format: enums are internally tagged with `type` (`{"type":"addRepository",...}`),
//! fields are camelCase.
